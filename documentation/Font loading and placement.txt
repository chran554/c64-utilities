Setting bit 1 through 3 on memory address $D018 change the character font bank start.
The font bank is a three bit value which gives a value range of 0-7.
A character font bank is 2kb large ($800 byte). 
The font bank start adress is relative to the VIC bank start adress. 

Bit pattern of byte at memory address $D018 (while in text screen mode): 
         +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
         |SCB|SCB|SCB|SCB|CFB|CFB|CFB| - |
         +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
Bit nr:    7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
SCB = Screen Character Bank
CFB = Character Font Bank

Calculation example: 
Assuming Text screen mode
Assuming using VIC bank 0 (which is default upon C64 start/reset with memory address range $0000-$3FFF thus size $4000=16k bytes). 
To use character font bank 7, (the last possible font bank) within the current VIC bank, set memory location $D018 bit 1 through 3 to value %111 = #7. 
This gives font bitmap data start at address: <VIC bank start address> + (<font bank size> * <font bank>) = $0000 + ($800 * #7) = $3800

Assembler example:
; Set character font bitmap data start at address $3800
LDA $D018
ORA #%00001110   ; Set/fiddle with bit 1-3 only, leave bit 0 and 4-7 alone  
STA $D018  

Note/information: 
Do not set/change any other bits than 1 through 3 using text screen mode
as the high nibble (bit 4 through 7) point out the screen character bank (value range: 0-15) of size $0400.
